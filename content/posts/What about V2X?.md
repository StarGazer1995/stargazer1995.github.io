title: What about V2X?

Basically, v2x means vehicle to everything. But how we use this kind of technology into autonomous driving? Or, in other words, what kind of advantages does V2X provide?

Some say the road side sensor can detect car crash and letting nearby vehicles know. And they believe that the RSU could detect pedestrians outside the detection range of vehicle as thus prevent crashing. People also argue that V2X could be used as a valuable add-on to autonomous system as it provides precise traffic information. It seems like V2X technology has a bright future.

Despite a lot of articles buy in the future of V2X, I doubt it because of the world is real. V2X equipments are expensive and computing demanding. This drawback makes the implementation of V2X sensor impractical for now. Implementation requires a lot of resources for achieving, and the government is not interested. More, the latency of data transmission is another problem. We cannot transmit raw sensor data among vehicles. If we limit the latency into 100ms, we can do is transmit the object level information. And a objective reason is the security and privacy problem of the data, which requires a large effort from the government. So, V2X implementation could be impractical for right now.
