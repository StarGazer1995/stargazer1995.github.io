# About me

A Ph.D. candidate with a love of photography and programming.

# Site

This site is build based on Hugo, Notion and [notion2markdown-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/notion2markdown-action).

All the images are hosted on Notion, and access to web through the temporary links valid for 1 hour.

So the GitHub Action will synchronize the pages `every 10 minutes` to keep it up to date!

> I don’t need to consider the cost of usage of GitHub Action because it’s a [public repository](https://github.com/Doradx/doradx.github.io).

[Here](https://github.com/Doradx/doradx.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/notion2hugo.yml) you can find the workflow of the GitHub Action `Notion2Hugo.yml`.
